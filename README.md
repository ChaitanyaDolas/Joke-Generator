# Joke Generator
### I was bored and I was scrolling through github then came across a Joke Generator api. So I thought why not to cure my boredom by creating a joke generator web app.
The project is deployed [here](https://joke-generator-eta-sage.vercel.app/).

## Features
* Random Joke Generation: Fetches a random joke from the Official Joke API and displays it on the screen.
* Responsive Design: The application is designed to work seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
* Reload Button: Allows users to fetch a new random joke with the click of a button.
* Custom Styling: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for custom styling, ensuring a modern and visually appealing user interface.
* FontAwesome Icons: Integrates FontAwesome icons for enhanced visual elements, providing a delightful user experience.

## Technologies Used
* Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, FontAwesome
* Backend: Node.js, Express
* API: Official Joke API

## Deployment
The application is deployed using [Render](https://render.com/) for backend [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for frontend.

This was a fun small project which helped me grasp the understanding of the APIs, Material UI, Axios, Cors and Tailwind CSS.
