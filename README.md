# Joke Generator
### I was bored and I was scrolling through github then came across a Joke Generator api. So I thought why not to cure my boredom by creating a joke generator web app.

This was a fun small project which helped me grasp the understanding of the APIs, Material UI, Axios, Cors and Tailwind CSS.
